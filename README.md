# cool-batch-animation

code is filthy, and the animation is really flickery, but it does the job. you can replace the text with anything your heart desires as long as it consists of 10 lines. 

## how to change the text
### premiere etape: get the text
Go to <a href="https://www.asciiart.eu/text-to-ascii-art">this website</a>
Input your text and change the settigns as shown in this screenshot

### deuxieme etape: set the text to a variable

in order for the code to read the text you must set one by one every single line to a variable. you can either do it manually, which will take 27 seconds OR if you're lazy like me, you can download <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">NotePad++</a> and do it in 3 seconds.

after you're done with the installation, open the text file where you pasted the ASCII using Notepad++ (just right-click, go to 'Open with', and choose Notepad++). hold down the right mouse button at the leftmost part of your text and drag it down to the last row/line. this will change the cursor height and let you type at the same time across all 10 rows.

for the code to recognize the string/text you must add this besides your text on every single line

`set "letters1=`This Will Be The Text`"`

the **text** should look like this:

## etape trois: apply the text to the code

now all you have to do is copy and paste your <u>formatted</u> text into the code just like illustrated below

and voila, you learned a tad bit of french, a small portion of NotePad++ and how to make some flickering animated text!
